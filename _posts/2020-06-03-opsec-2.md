### Secure device acquisitions

It is very important to remark that our first interaction with the device and therefore the organization's (the one we belong in) with the device begins at the very moment we decide to acquire. I dare to affirm that the average reader is not in possession of an advanced electronics lab and a or a smartphone factory (I guess that the reader would have a whole set of different problems in that case) and unfortunately for us the old _yogurt-phone_ is very impractical when it comes to the operational activity therefore we'll have acquire a personal device somewhere out there is a safe way.

This section will be about that.

The acquisition of those "operational" devices can be done in several ways, each of them presenting a series of associated risks. As min many contexts in life, especially when it comes to operational activities, there is no magic recipe, no master trick or shortcut, therefore we must know about enough appropiate alternatives along with their risks to be able to decide according to our personal context. 

#### Online acquisitions

In our daily life, nowadays, this will probably be our prefeered purchasing option, the one that we are most used to, mainly due to its comfort and effectivenes. However in terms of operantional security, this may not be the best way to acquire a device.

When we acquire a device through an online store we must take several associated peculiarities into account. First of all, we must be aware that an "online store" is still a piece of software installed on a computer system, so any kind of interaction we may make with it is subject to being stored and tracked for an indefinite number of time. So, for purchasing a new device such a laptop or a smartphone in an online store in general terms we'll start by needing to create a new user and for that to provide som personal information as the first and lastnames along with an e-mail, such data can be easily faked and we can create "anonymous" e-mails easily, however we'll also need to provide a valid delivery address along with a payment method (a credit card for example) and that'll be harder to "fake", "unlink from us" or "cheat". Data like that as it will be stored in a computer system is always subject to being accessed not only by the store owners but also by third parties: On one hand a police agency may access that data by making use of some judicial warrant/order on the other hand a potential adversary with enough time/skill/money can access that (your) information through for example some kind of computer attack or by accessing ("buying") an internal employee on the site.

So that would be the first risk associated with this method, the risk of having our personal identity being linked to the site especially via the payment and the delivery address, we'll call it the "identity" risk. The mitigation of this kind of risk is possible however it can be complicated espepcially in future days as the banking sector and the payment industry harden their identity checks and enhance their fraud mitigation systems...

Regarding to data such as personal names or e-mails, as mentioned, those can be easily faked, the first and last names can be easily faked and any kind of free mail server that does not require a valid phone number such as protonmail or gmx can be used to create a custom mail address anonymously by using a VPN or TOR. But when it comes to the physical delivery address, you just can let your imagination fly sky high as there are many custom ways of making _effective and safe deliveries_ and those will depend a lot on your personal context and the kind of adversary you may have. Nowadays many online stores like amazon do offer the change of having the package sent to a specific delivery point, once the package arrives only some digit combination is needed to unlock the thing and get it, this may partially solve the problem but note that the store will still have the record of the purchase  including the virtual payment. Some other sites would send the package to physical delivery points located inside actual physical stores for an easy pick-up, but those would probably requiere a driving license / personal id card or some kind of document as a proof of identity (for obvious reasons).

Another strategy that may be valid for you and partially solves the problem as well consists in sending the package to a small business somewhere far from your place and then picking it up there to avoid a potential identification from being recorded.

This scheme is easy: first of all you'll locate a small business like a small shop or a bar in an area that is far from the "operational area" or your usual residence. Then you'll send the package there. Once you detect that the package has reached the destination, you can simple show up there and claim it, saying something like you are just and neighbor and this package was very important and you were not home so you told the delivery person just to send it there, they will probably believe you as you'll show details stating that about the package that has just arrived and no one has ordered there, you can still show your id as a proof, they'll just forget about your name after a couple of hours so... identification risk is low there.

You may think that previously contacting the people in charge of the place you'll deliver to, to arange the whole thing is very important or even mandatory but just note that if you do this a couple of things can happen: they may simply refuse "your offer" to avoid potential complications and extra work, they may also start asking uncomfortable questions or on the other hand they may accept our proposal but then show excessive curiosity towards the package, and we don't want that. We have to take the possibility of us being under an actual police/pe/intelligence investigation into account, so an actual adversary can be somehow be at our footsteps making the pertinent investigations on our relationship with the small shop/bar. So the spontaneous and the unpredictable is always the most difficult to trace. Again, we'll chosee the strategy that best suits us according to the context of the chosen establishment and our own context (do we have any evidence or strong indicators that we are being followed or under a formal investigation?) but generally speaking, it is usually a good thing to do some social engineering and have a good relationship with the place we are going to deliver to, especially if we want to use it as a deliver place for a set of packages over time during a certain period, if we just want to receive a single order there is no need of doing that. Whatever the strategy you decide to follow, it would be preferable to do not warn the owner about new arrivals and just get to the place as soon as the package arrived to avoid unnecessary questions and curiosity. Experience has shown me that local small establishments, run by women, elderly people and / or foreign population, usually work well for this kind of operations. A good strategy when picking up orders that just arrived is to spend some time at the establishment ordering something like a coffee or a soda and just before paying use the chosen cover-up to claim the package and once received, leave the establishment without further interaction.
